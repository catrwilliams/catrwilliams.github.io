          <h2 class="lead">Education</h2>
          <p>I have a BA in Criminology and an MBA, with concentrations in Management Information Systems and Information Assurance, both from the University of New Mexico.</p>
          <p class="about">In June 2019, I completed a certificate program with University of Washington for <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-analytics-techniques-for-decision-making" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Analytics: Techniques for Decision Making</a>. The courses I took were <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/data-analysis-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Analysis Essentials</a>, <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/data-visualization-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Visualization Essentials</a>, and <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/data-mining-and-predictive-analytics-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Mining &amp; Predictive Analytics Essentials</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="lead">Experience</h2>
          <p>My most recent employer was GE Digital where I was hired as a part of their <a href="https://jobs.gecareers.com/global/en/digital-technology-leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Leadership Technology Program (ITLP)</a> (now rebranded as DTLP). This is a rotational program that places you in various different technical job roles in order to expand business and technical acumen. As a part of this program, I got my first professional taste of data analysis using SiSense. I instantly fell in love with the field and since then, have been pursuing a career in data.</p>

My involvement with NEST included organizing and conducting meetings, creating technical tutorials, organizing and obtaining funding for competitions and conferences, as well as networking and hosting guest speakers.</p>
          <p class="about">Currently, I am involved in several data meetups, such as Seattle Women in Data Science and R-Ladies Seattle.
